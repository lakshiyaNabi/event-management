This project is a fully responsive Event Management Website developed using HTML and CSS with a modern and colorful design. The website represents a professional event management company offering services such as weddings, engagements, birthday parties, corporate events, and family functions. It includes multiple sections like a hero banner, about us, services, packages, gallery, booking form, and contact details. The design focuses on premium visuals, smooth layout, and user-friendly navigation to showcase event services effectively. This project demonstrates my front-end development skills and ability to create visually appealing, real-world business websites.
